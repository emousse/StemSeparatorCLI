# Changelog

All notable changes to Stem Separator will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Windows/Linux support for system audio recording
- Additional AI models (MDX-Net variations, VR Architecture)
- Batch export functionality
- Real-time preview during processing
- Custom model training interface
- VST/AU plugin version
- Cloud-based processing (optional)
- Mobile app (iOS/Android)

## [1.0.2] - 2025-12-19

### Fixed
- **Export Loops Widget - Time-Stretched Loops Export**
  - Fixed "Use Time-Stretched Loops" checkbox not working correctly
  - Export now correctly uses time-stretched loops when checkbox is enabled
  - Fixed loop segment inconsistency between Looping tab and Export Loops tab
  - Export now uses the same `valid_loops` (filtered to exclude intro loops with negative start times) that were used during time-stretching
  - Added stem name normalization (lowercase) for consistent cache access
  - Checkbox now only enables when all loops are ready (not just some)
  - Export aborts with warning if time-stretching is incomplete (no silent fallback to original loops)
  - Works correctly for both export modes (Mixed Audio and Individual Stems)
  - Properly handles intro loops (leading loops with padding are correctly filtered out)
