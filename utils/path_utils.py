Path Resolution Utilities

PURPOSE: Provide utilities for resolving and ensuring output paths are absolute
         and directories exist, preventing issues with relative paths in packaged apps.
CONTEXT: Packaged macOS apps have unpredictable working directories, so all paths
         must be resolved to absolute paths before use.

    Resolve output path to absolute, ensuring directory exists.

    WHY: Packaged apps have unpredictable working directories. Relative paths
         must be resolved to absolute paths to ensure files are saved correctly.
         This function handles None/empty paths, relative paths, and ensures
         directories are created.

    Args:
        path: Optional path (may be None, relative, or absolute)
        default: Default path to use if path is None or empty

    Returns:
        Absolute Path object with directory created if needed

    Examples:
        >>> default = Path.home() / "Music" / "StemSeparator" / "separated"
        >>> resolve_output_path(None, default)
        Path('/Users/name/Music/StemSeparator/separated')
